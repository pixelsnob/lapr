# Project Timeline

## Discovery Phase

### Data

- Import data from old site and export as CSV and/or spreadsheet
- Define product fields based on this data; so far, on the old site, there is:
  - name
  - category (ethnic drums, accessories, etc.)
  - description
  - maker
  - price
- Fix, format, correct misspellings, recategorize items, and create new fields if necessary
- Latest CSV is here: [lapr.csv](lapr.csv)
- Are we using any of the old images?

### Front-End

#### Layout

Decide how the pages will be organized, where the menus will be, roughly what pages are where. Figure out what pages will need to be editable by you, etc.

#### Home Page

How will the homepage be organized? Will there be a slide show/montage?

#### Search Interface

Decide how the products will be searched for on the site, taking into account any past/current user input, as well as your own knowledge of what people are searching for, and how to make it as easy as possible to do it.

- Will we be keeping the product categories in the menu like the current site? 
- What kind of search do you want? Full text search? Do we also want to filter by maker, and maybe a couple of other fields?
- What kind of options are needed for sorting of long lists of instruments?

### CMS (Back-End Administration System)

A couple of things will need to be added to the CMS.

#### Products

- Add/edit/delete pages
- Should also be able to delete product categories, and assign products to those categories

#### Users (not critical, but probably useful)

Because I'm assuming there will be more than one user on this system...

- Add/edit/delete pages
- Password change/reset

## Dev/Design Phase

- Make an unstyled, ugly but working prototype
- Locate a designer
- Implement design using prototype
- Test
- Launch!
