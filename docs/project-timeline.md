# Project Timeline

## Discovery Phase

### Data

- Import data from old site and export as CSV and/or spreadsheet
- Define product fields based on this data; so far, on the old site, there is:
  - name
  - category (ethnic drums, accessories, etc.)
  - description
  - maker
  - price
- Fix, format, correct misspellings, recategorize items if necessary; this can be done in the spreadsheet, or we can wait until the admin for add/edit/delete products is done, it doesn't really matter

### Front-End Search Interface

Decide how the products will be searched for on the site

- Will we be keeping the product categories in the menu like the current site? 
- What kind of search do you want? Full text search? Do we also want to search by maker, and maybe range?
