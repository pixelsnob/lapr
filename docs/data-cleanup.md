# Data Cleanup

## Additional Fields

- tonal_range_low: C1-C5, etc.
- tonal_range_high
- alt_names: for instruments that have multiple names, instead of piling all of that in the description :)
- num_octaves: nice to have, probably not necessary, or maybe can be calculated from range fields
- long_description: for the Emil Richards "more info..." descriptions, etc. -- or maybe we just use description for it
